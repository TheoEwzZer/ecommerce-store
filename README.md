It keeps track of whether the modal is open, the data that the modal is rendering, and provides functions to open and close the modal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It returns a string of merged classes. Also, it exports a number formatter for currency in European format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It uses the useState and useEffect hooks from React to manage the state of whether the component is mounted or not. If the component is not mounted, null is returned. Otherwise, the PreviewModal is rendered.                                                                                                                                                                |

It provides a clean and concise way to display temporary messages to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
